RABBIT MQ NOTES
---------------

- Connection: A TCP connection that should be "long-lived", as low numbered as possible, made to the message broker
		• TCP connections are resource intensive, handshakes, etc

- Channel: Multiple "light-weight" connections can multiplex over a single TCP connection, these "light-weight" connections are called channels
		• In other words, one TCP Connection can host a number of channels
		• Channels are cheap to open and close, on the other hand connections are not.

- Binding Key: The key that specifies which messages are allowed to the Queue that is Bound
		
		Exchange --------BINDING_KEY-------> Queue

- Routing Key: The key attached to a message that would help Exchange route the message to the correct Queue using the rule:

		WHERE ROUTING_KEY_IN_MSG == BINDING_KEY_OF_QUEUE		## In case of direct exchange

=============================================

Direct Exchange: Routes using basinc equality between routing key and binding key
Topic Exchange: Routes using wildcards in the routing key
		(.) delimiter	:	list of keys
		(*) delimiter	:	matches keys at specific position
		(#) bound symbol:	matches one or more keys
