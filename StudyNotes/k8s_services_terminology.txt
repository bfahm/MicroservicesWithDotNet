Kubernetes 
	CLUSTER: The whole setup
		Must contain at least one Master (Control-Plane), could be more than one master
		Must contain at least one Node

	NODE: A machine (either virtual or physical)
		Each node has a set of PODS, Pods represent different applications and services running inside the node
		
	POD: An abstraction over containers
		A pod might hold a single or multiple containers

----------------

ClusterIP	A service that exposes application through a port, only accessible within the cluster

NodePort	A service that exposes application through a the node's public IP address and a Port
		(Need to manage the Node's IP Address, that's why it's not the best approach for exposure)

LoadBalancer	A service accessible through it's IP address (usually provided by your cloud provider)
		It then forwards the request to a nodePort
